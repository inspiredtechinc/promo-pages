## ðŸ›  How to Deploy a New Project

1. Create a new branch named `project-<your-id>` (e.g., `project-y`).
2. Add your static HTML files to the branch.
3. Push the branch to GitHub:
	```sh
	git checkout -b project-y
	# Add your files
	git add .
	git commit -m "Add project-y landing page"
	git push origin project-y
	```
4. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy your branch to:
	`https://inspiredtechinc.github.io/promo-pages/project-y/`

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Only branches named `project-*` are deployed and previewable.
- You can add as many project-* branches as you need.
- No custom domain or build step requiredâ€”just static files!
